Class Notes

Summer Institute of Statistics Modeling Infectious Diseases (SISMID) July 15-17, 2015

Module 11: Introduction to Metagenomic Data Analysis 

Instructors: Alexander V. Alekseyenko and Paul J. McMurdie II

Module description: This course is concerned with multivariate statistical analysis of 
microbiome data. We will briefly cover foundational concepts in microbial ecology, 
molecular biology, bioinformatics, and DNA sequencing. The main focus of the course will 
be on developing an understanding of multivariate analysis of microbiome data. Practical 
skills to be developed in this course include managing high-dimensional and structured 
data in metagenomics, visualization and representation of high-dimensional data, 
normalization, filtering, and mixture-model noise modeling of count data, as well as 
clustering and predictive model building. Programming will be done in R and fluency at 
the level of ‘SISMID/SISG Module 4: Introduction to R’ will be expected. 
Pre-requisites: knowledge of Module 1, Probability and Statistical Inference.
Co-listed with the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics.

Session 1:

Introductions:
	Alex: http://www.med.nyu.edu/biosketch/aleksa01
	Joey: https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nNQ1LtMAAAAJ

	Diverse group!!

	This course covers three forks: Microbiology, Molecular biology/technology, and 
	Bioinformatics

Lecture 1 - Metagenomics in Biology:
	Exciting and emerging field -- largely due to high throughput data

Lecture 2 - Sequencing technology and upstream processing:
	This course is on downstream processing
		*my MG rhizosphere data is 454 sequencing of 16S gene

Laboratory 1: Sequence pre-processing w/QIIME
	Host: ec2-54-157-46-245.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	Username: student03
	Password: test123
	
	http://qiime.org/tutorials/tutorial.html
	
	Open up terminal:
		ssh student03@ec2-54-157-46-245.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	
		cd qiime_overview_tutorial/
		ls
			Fasting_Example.fna #contains sequences
			> #deliminator symbol
			less #open up file for veiwing
			.qual #is the quality file; -log probabilities of error, higher the number 
				less probability of an error; e^-37
			the quality values for 454 is almost useless
			Fasting_Map.txt #maps the barcode with the descriptions
				sample id, barcode sequence, primer sequence (generic), 
				
			after run look at 
			then log will tell you the number of sequence per sample
			
Session 2:

Laboratory 1: continued; alternative OTU picking
	UPARSE - part of usearch of Qiime *recomended	
	There are denoiser - takes care of homopolymers - specific for 454 data
		*base by base quality is not very useful for 454
		*just use illumina now
	Workflow developed by Joey
		Trim first
		filter after trimming
		Then UPARSE

		*there is an alternative to OTU clustering 
		
		This workshop is not on OTU clustering -- we are going to focus on analysis to do
		after OTU clustering

Lecture 3: Microbiome downstream processing pipeline
	Markdown -- transition from LaTex and Sweave
	
Lab 2: Introduction to phyloseq
		*see R scripts

Thur 16 July

Session 3:

Lecture 4: Descriptive statistics and normalizations
	Simpsons, Shannons, etc. Like from ecology
	Need to normalize based off of unequal sequencing
	
Laboratory 3: Quality control, transformations
	This is an example on different ways to begin your data analysis	
	.Rdata saves your data in a way that R can pull it up quickly
		

Session 4:

Lecture 5: Testing and Multiple Testing

Laboratory 4: Filtering, testing, multiple comparison

	Avoid doing more tests than you need because you will have to correct for
	multiple comparisons

Session 5:

Lecture 6: Mixture models for microbiome data
	do not rarefy

Laboratory 5: Mixture models for differential abundance testing
	Non parametric way to deal with this is SAMseq {samr} 
		(alternative to negative binomial)
	Neg binomial: if it fits well, it will be very sensitive
		use diagnostic plots to see if that is a good fit

Session 6:

Lecture 7: Ecological distance metrics; Principal Coordinate Analysis
	What to do with distances and beta diversity
	Principal component regression
	MDS and PCA is the same thing
	
Laboratory 6: Computing distance matrices; PCoA
	set seed because you want it to be reproducable
	principal coordinate analysis - pick the number of axis based off scree plot
		if you want to include look to the right one, you might want to include that too
		if it explains the same amount of variation
	the negative variability is due to non euclidean distances, corrected with cailliez
		or adding a small constant to all
	
	There is a large difference between location (fecal vs cecal)
	You can't tell a difference between treatment because it is obscured by location
	do wca to center both locations to focus on differences of treatment
	 
=========================================================================================

Fri 17 July

Session 7:

Lecture 10: Generalized multivariate analysis of variance
	Now we are going to explore if there is statistical significance between groups
	It is just like MANOVA but with distances (e.g. Shannon's, JSD, etc) instead of means
	
Laboratory 9: ADONIS and permutation testing
	distance is equivalent to multivariate spread, or variation between groups
	dist.perm.test(jsd.dist.cecal, cecal.treatment, 999)
	  #these are the p-values
	The adonis test might not always be appropriate, for example one group with a lot of
	varaiation and another group with a small variation - with different centers. You 
	don't want your groups to have vastly different variances. The same is true with
	regular anova - you can't compare groups with vastly different variances. There are
	assumptions that you must hold to.
	One thing that you could do is just report the differences, there just might not be
	a statistical test, but who needs a p-value if you can visually describe it

Session 8:

Lecture x: Denoising
	The End of OTU's = the standard approach [...](OTUs), underexploits the accuracy of 
	modern sequencing technology.
	Tikhonov, et al
	
	Motivation
		What is an OTU really?
			*a lot of this is just PCR and sequencing errors
			*OTU - is "operational"
			*OTU useful for high level things
	DADA
		De Novo Amplicon Denoising without Training Data or Experimental Design 
		Requirement (DADA - Rosen et al)
	
		Which sequences are real and which have errors?
		Top down approach - assume the most abundant sequences are real the less are errors
		One downside of OTU clustering it is highly dependent on input data included
			your clustering changes as augmented, doesn't scale well, hard to replicate
		Parallelize computing

		Exceptions: Chimeras are not resolved (still need to do chimera detection)

	shiny-phyloseq
	
Laboratory 8: Data and network manipulation with phyloseq
	error on Chunk 19 and followed up by 20 & 21 
	This is corrected in the newer version of R/Phyloseq
	Clear list: rm(list = ls())

	To play around with both R in R studio while running shiny-phyloseq, you can run
	shiny-phyloseq in terminal
	R

Session 9:

Lecture 11: Networks
	use this (not to capture dynamics) to capture correlations
	dynamics go with Lotka-Volterra
	not really sure where to go next with these networks
	Maybe compare networks from different treatments
	maybe use them to try to make prediction models
	
	
Laboratory 10: Graphical models for microbiome data
	I have no idea what was going on with this tutorial :(


Session 10:

Lecture 8: Machine learning with microbiome data
	Word of warning about hierarchical clustering: you can cluster anything
	interesting paper with clustering: http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/1/1/31

Laboratory 7: Clustering and classification
	Don't use hierarchical clustering unless you really have to and you know 
	why you are doing it
