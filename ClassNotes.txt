Class Notes

Summer Institute of Statistics Modeling Infectious Diseases (SISMID) July 15-17, 2015

Module 11: Introduction to Metagenomic Data Analysis 

Instructors: Alexander V. Alekseyenko and Paul J. McMurdie II

Module description: This course is concerned with multivariate statistical analysis of 
microbiome data. We will briefly cover foundational concepts in microbial ecology, 
molecular biology, bioinformatics, and DNA sequencing. The main focus of the course will 
be on developing an understanding of multivariate analysis of microbiome data. Practical 
skills to be developed in this course include managing high-dimensional and structured 
data in metagenomics, visualization and representation of high-dimensional data, 
normalization, filtering, and mixture-model noise modeling of count data, as well as 
clustering and predictive model building. Programming will be done in R and fluency at 
the level of ‘SISMID/SISG Module 4: Introduction to R’ will be expected. 
Pre-requisites: knowledge of Module 1, Probability and Statistical Inference.
Co-listed with the Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics.
